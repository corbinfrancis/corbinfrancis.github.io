<p>Still, with so much choice available, and with a lot jargon surrounding the subject of office telephones, it can be tough to understand where to start. While Digital Phone Systems are practical and practical; they're not mobile. However, if your business must comply with security policies that need data to be saved on-site, then a hosted service is most likely not the best service. The only difference in between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower expense these days's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the standard phone networks (the conventional phone lines) rather of the Internet (as holds true with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
<p>Calls from your smart phone will appear as your office phone in Caller ID. Because the voice signal is separated into data packets as an IP call, spread over the internet, and reassembled at its location (kind of like a Star Trek transporter), instead of binding a copper peer-to-peer landline circuit, phone calls are more economical through VoIP-- another savings point. Rather of utilizing telephone lines, VoIP utilizes SIP trunks (SIP stands for session initiation procedure).</p>
